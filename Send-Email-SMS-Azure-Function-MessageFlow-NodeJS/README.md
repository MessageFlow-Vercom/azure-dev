# Deploy a Node.js Azure Function + MessageFlow API

Complete integration of email and SMS delivery using Azure Node.js function app and the MessageFlow API.

---

## Requirements

- MessageFlow account ([Register here](https://app.messageflow.com/register))
- API key with appropriate permissions (SMS, email)
- An [Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free) with an active subscription
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [Azure Functions extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions) for Visual Studio Code
- [Azure Functions Core Tools](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local) version 4.x
- [Node.js 18.x or above](https://nodejs.org/) (verify with `node --version`)
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) (for testing)

---

## Introduction

If you want to use the SMS messaging function, select the MessageFlowSmsFunction directory, and if you want to use the email messaging function, select the MessageFlowEmailFunction directory. The example below is based on SMS, but the function is launched in the same way in both cases.

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Create a MessageFlow Account

- Register: [https://app.messageflow.com/register](https://app.messageflow.com/register)
- Confirm email and phone number
- Fill in company details and select services (SMS, Email)

### 2. Generate an API Key

- Navigate to the "Account" -> "Settings" -> "API" tab
- Click "New API Key"
- Name the key and set permissions, you need to select options "Transactional e-mail" and "Transactional SMS"
- Save the following values:
  - `ApplicationKey`
  - `Authorization`

> Keep your credentials secure — they will be needed in code!

> If you received "Creating API keys impossible until account approved by customer service office" error it might be that your account has not yet been activated. If this process takes longer than 3 hours, please contact our support team to verify your identity.

---

### 3. Additional Requirements

To send emails we require two more things:

- Domain in the FROM field must be verified. You can do this in "Email" -> "Common settings" -> "Senders authorization". More information you can read [here](https://docs.messageflow.com/technical-support-center/senders-authorization/how-to-authorize-senders-in-messageflow/domains-authorization)
- Your personal "smtpAccount", you can get it from the MessageFlow application. Navigate to "Email" -> "Email API" -> "Settings" -> "SMTP Accounts"

To send SMS messages, you need to add a sender ID. You can do this in "SMS" -> "Common settings" -> "Sender IDs". More information you can read [here](https://docs.messageflow.com/communication-channels-in-the-panel/sms/sms-common-settings/sender-ids)

## Project Structure

This repository contains two separate Azure Functions, each in its own directory:

```
MessageFlowEmailFunction/          # Email function (deploy separately)
├── src/
│   ├── functions/
│   │   └── emailFunction.js       # Email HTTP trigger
│   └── services/
│       └── emailService.js        # Email service logic
├── host.json                      # Function app configuration
├── package.json                   # Node.js dependencies
├── local.settings.example.json    # Example configuration
└── .gitignore                     # Git ignore rules

MessageFlowSmsFunction/            # SMS function (deploy separately)
├── src/
│   ├── functions/
│   │   └── smsFunction.js         # SMS HTTP trigger
│   └── services/
│       └── smsService.js          # SMS service logic
├── host.json                      # Function app configuration

├── local.settings.example.json    # Example configuration
└── .gitignore                     # Git ignore rules
```

---

## Secure Credential Storage

### Locally (`local.settings.json`):

Create a `local.settings.json` file (copy from `local.settings.example.json`):

```json
{
  "IsEncrypted": false,
  "Values": {
    "AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true",
    "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "node",
    "RestApiApplicationKey": "your-application-key-here",
    "RestApiAuthorization": "your-authorization-key-here"
  }
}
```

> You can copy the `local.settings.example.json` file, rename it to `local.settings.json`, and fill it in with your MessageFlow credentials.

### In Azure Portal:

- Go to: App Service -> Settings -> Environment variables
- Add two variables:
  - `RestApiApplicationKey`
  - `RestApiAuthorization`

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the directory of the function you want to use:

**For Email function:**

```bash
cd Send-Email-SMS-Azure-Function-MessageFlow-NodeJS/MessageFlowEmailFunction
```

**For SMS function:**

```bash
cd Send-Email-SMS-Azure-Function-MessageFlow-NodeJS/MessageFlowSmsFunction
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure `local.settings.json` with valid API keys (see above):

```bash
# Copy the example file
cp local.settings.example.json local.settings.json
# Then edit local.settings.json with your MessageFlow credentials
```

---

## Running the Function Locally

1. Make sure you have Node.js 18.x or above installed:

```bash
node --version
```

2. Start Azurite (local Azure Storage emulator):

   - In VS Code, press F1 and run: **Azurite: Start**
   - Or install and run manually: [Azurite Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azurite)

3. Start the function:

```bash
func start
```

Or use npm:

```bash
npm start
```

You should see output similar to:

```
Functions:
  MessageFlowEmailHttpTrigger: [POST] http://localhost:7071/api/MessageFlowEmailHttpTrigger
  MessageFlowSmsHttpTrigger: [POST] http://localhost:7071/api/MessageFlowSmsHttpTrigger
```

## Key Features - Node.js v4 Programming Model

This implementation uses the **Azure Functions Node.js v4 programming model**, which provides:

### Modern Function Registration

Functions are registered using the `app` object from `@azure/functions`:

```javascript
const { app } = require("@azure/functions");

app.http("MessageFlowEmailHttpTrigger", {
  methods: ["POST"],
  authLevel: "anonymous",
  handler: async (request, context) => {
    // Function logic here
  },
});
```

### Context Object

The `context` object provides structured logging and metadata:

```javascript
context.log("Info message"); // Information logging
context.warn("Warning message"); // Warning logging
context.error("Error message"); // Error logging
```

### Request/Response Handling

Uses the Fetch API standard for HTTP handling:

```javascript
// Read request body
const body = await request.text();
const data = JSON.parse(body);

// Return response
return {
  status: 200,
  body: JSON.stringify({ success: true }),
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
};
```

### Service Layer Architecture

- **emailService.js** - Handles all email-related API calls to MessageFlow
- **smsService.js** - Handles all SMS-related API calls to MessageFlow
- Services are instantiated once and reused across invocations for better performance

---

## Your Own Solution

You can also copy the `emailService.js` or `smsService.js` file and use them in your own Node.js code. Both services are self-contained and only require:

- MessageFlow API credentials (via environment variables)
- Node.js built-in `https` module

Example usage:

```javascript
const EmailService = require("./services/emailService");
const emailService = new EmailService();

const result = await emailService.sendEmailAsync(emailRequest, context);
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Function not starting locally

- Make sure Azurite is running (F1 -> Azurite: Start)
- Check that Node.js version is 18.x or above
- Verify `local.settings.json` exists and contains valid configuration

### API returns 401 Unauthorized

- Check that `RestApiApplicationKey` and `RestApiAuthorization` are set correctly
- Verify the API keys in MessageFlow dashboard
