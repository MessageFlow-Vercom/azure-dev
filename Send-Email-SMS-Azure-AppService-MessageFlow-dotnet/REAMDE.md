### 3. Additional requirements

To send emails we require two more things:

- domain in the FROM field must be verified. You can do this in ‚ÄúEmail‚Äù->‚ÄúCommon settings‚Äù->‚ÄúSenders authorization‚Äù. More information you can read [here](https://docs.messageflow.com/technical-support-center/senders-authorization/how-to-authorize-senders-in-messageflow/domains-authorization)
- your personal "smtpAccount", you can get it from the MessageFlow application. Navigate to ‚ÄúEmail‚Äù->‚ÄúEmail API‚Äù->‚ÄúSettings‚Äù->‚ÄúSMTP Accounts‚Äù

To send SMS messages, you need to add a sender ID. You can do this in ‚ÄúSMS‚Äù->‚ÄúCommon settings‚Äù->‚ÄúSender IDs‚Äù. More information you can read [here](https://docs.messageflow.com/communication-channels-in-the-panel/sms/sms-common-settings/sender-ids)

## Secure Credential Storage

```json
{
  "RestApi": {
    "ApplicationKey": "your-app-key",
    "Authorization": "your-auth-key"
  }
}
```

You can copy the appsettings.example.json file, rename it to appsettings.json, and fill it in with your MessageFlow credentials.

### In Azure Portal:

- Go to: App Service ‚Üí Configuration ‚Üí Application Settings
- Add two variables:
  - `ApplicationKey`
