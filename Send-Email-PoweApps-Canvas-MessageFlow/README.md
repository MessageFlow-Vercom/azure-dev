# Integrate MessageFlow API with Power Apps Canvas App and Azure Function

This tutorial shows how to send emails using the MessageFlow REST API and Azure Function from an Power Apps Canvas App.

---

## Requirements

- MessageFlow account ([Register here](https://app.messageflow.com/register))
- API key with appropriate permissions (email)
- Deployed [Azure Function](https://portal.azure.com) (if you want to add access restrictions, secure them with [Entra ID](https://entra.microsoft.com))
- An [Power Apps account](https://make.powerapps.com)
- An [Power Automate account](https://make.powerautomate.com)

## Quick Start

### 1. Create a MessageFlow Account

- Register: [https://app.messageflow.com/register](https://app.messageflow.com/register)
- Confirm email and phone number
- Fill in company details and select services (Email)

### 2. Generate an API Key

- Navigate to the "Account" -> "Settings" -> "API" tab
- Click "New API Key"
- Name the key and set permissions, you need to select options "Transactional e-mail"
- Save the following values:
  - `ApplicationKey`
  - `Authorization`

> Keep your credentials secure — they will be needed in code!

> If you received "Creating API keys impossible until account approved by customer service office" error it might be that your account has not yet been activated. If this process takes longer than 3 hours, please contact our support team to verify your identity.

---

### 3. Additional requirements

To send emails we require two more things:

- domain in the FROM field must be verified. You can do this in "Email"->"Common settings"->"Senders authorization". More information you can read [here](https://docs.messageflow.com/technical-support-center/senders-authorization/how-to-authorize-senders-in-messageflow/domains-authorization)
- your personal "smtpAccount", you can get it from the MessageFlow application. Navigate to "Email" -> "Email API" -> "Settings" -> "SMTP Accounts"

---

> If you want to add access restrictions to your Azure Function, proceed to the next step and secure it with Entra ID. If not, proceed to "Create the Flow" step.

### 4. Secure Azure Function with Entra ID

- Go to [Microsoft Entra Admin Center](https://entra.microsoft.com)
- In the left menu, select "Applications" -> "App registrations"
- On the next screen click "+ New registration"
  - Fill in:
    - Name: `MessageFlowFunctionApp`
    - Supported account types: `Accounts in this organizational directory only (Single tenant)`
    - Redirect URI: Leave blank (not needed for backend APIs)
    - Click Register. After registration, copy:
      - Application (client) ID
      - Directory (tenant) ID

#

- In the App Registration, go to "Expose an API" in the left menu
- Click "Add" next to "Application ID URI"

  - Use: `api://<tenant-id>/<app-id>`

    - Example: `api://72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47/12345678-abcd-1234-abcd-1234567890ab`
    - Example: `api://<verified-domain>/<app-name>` - `api://example.com/messageflow-function` (only if `example.com` is a verified domain in your tenant)
    - Example: `api://<tenant-id>/messageflow-function`

    > You can find your "tenant ID" and "app ID" on the App Registration's Overview page.

  - Click Save

- Click "+ Add a scope" below
  - Scope name: `email.send`
  - Admin consent display name: `Send email via Azure Function`
  - Admin consent description: `Allows sending email using the secured Azure Function`
  - State: `Enabled`
  - Click `Add scope`

#

- Go to "API permissions"
- Click "+ Add a permission"
- Choose `Microsoft Graph` -> `Delegated permissions`
- Add `User.Read` (or other relevant permissions)
- Click "Add permission"
- Click "Click Grant admin consent for..." - next to "+ Add a permission" button

### 5. Enable Authentication in Azure Function

- Go to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
- Open your Function App overview
- In the left menu, select "Settings" -> "Authentication"
- Click "+ Add identity provider"
  - Provider: "Microsoft (Sign in Microsoft and Microsoft Entra identities and call Microsoft APIs)"
  - Choose a tenant for your application and its users: "Workforce configuration (current tenant)"
  - App registration type: "Pick an existing app registration in this directory"
  - Name or app ID: slect your Azure Function App
  - Client secret expiration: choose what you prefer
  - Client application requirement: "Allow requests only from this application itself"
  - Identity Requirement: "Allow requests from any identity"
  - Tenant requirement: "Allow requests only from the issuer tenant"
  - Restrict Access: "Require authentication"
  - Unauthenticated Requests: "HTTP 401 Unauthorized: recommended for APIs"
  - Token store: `enable`
- Click "Add"

### 8. Add HTTP Request Action

### 8. Add HTTP Request Action

- In the flow editor, click "Add a new step".
- Select the "HTTP" action.
- Configure the "HTTP" action as follows:

  - URI: `https://your-azure-function-url.azure.com/email`
  - Method: `POST`
  - Body:

    ```json
    {
      "subject": "",
      "smtpAccount": "",
      "from": {
        "email": "",
        "name": ""
      },
      "to": [
        {
          "email": "",
          "name": ""
        }
      ],
      "content": {
        "html": "",
        "text": ""
      }
    }
    ```

    Then in each parameter press the "/" key between "", select "Insert dynamic content" and choose the appropriate inputs from the previous step.

    or copy and paste this payload:

    ```json
    {
      "subject": "@{triggerBody()?['text']}",
      "smtpAccount": "@{triggerBody()?['text_1']}",
      "from": {
        "email": "@{triggerBody()?['email']}",
        "name": "@{triggerBody()?['text_2']}"
      },
      "to": [
        {
          "email": "@{triggerBody()?['email_1']}",
          "name": "@{triggerBody()?['text_3']}"
        }

      "content": {
        "html": "@{triggerBody()?['text_4']}",
        "text": "@{triggerBody()?['text_5']}"
      }
    }
